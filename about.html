            <p>Chapter 1:</p>
            <p>The city of Omega stood tall, a symbol of human achievement in the year 2152. It had been constructed over 130 years, but to Xelos, it was simply home. He was a brilliant young man, driven by his work in aetherial mechanics, but he had no idea what was about to happen. Xelos had been riding his photon cycle when he noticed a flash in the sky. It was so bright that it nearly blinded him, and it lasted only a fraction of a second. Confused, Xelos stopped his cycle and looked around, but there was nothing unusual to see.</p>
            <p>Then, he saw an old man standing nearby. Xelos didn't know why, but he felt drawn to him. As he approached the old man, he realized that the stranger was wearing a blindfold over one eye and had a prosthetic arm that used the same tech that Xelos worked with. Xelos was stunned and asked the old man how he had acquired his prosthetic.</p>
            <p>The old man, whose name was Chro, began to tell Xelos about aetherial mechanics and how it related to him. Chro revealed that he was more than 225 years old and began to explain the history of the city of Omega, how it had come to be in reality, not how most people had been taught to believe growing up.</p>
            <p>Xelos was fascinated by Chro's stories, but he had to go to class. As he left, Chro warned him that there was more to aetherial mechanics than he realized and that he should be careful.</p>
            <p>The next day, Xelos was on his way to class again when he noticed Chro talking to himself. Xelos approached him, and Chro began to talk about what it was like in the past and how the entire city had come to be. Xelos was amazed by Chro's stories and realized that there was much more to the old man than he had originally thought.</p>
            <p>Chro told Xelos that he had an eye patch and a prosthetic mecha limb because of his encounters with the blink time. Chro's hands began to shudder, and his patched eye began to glow with a cyan blue aura until he looked away. Xelos was intrigued and wanted to know more about the blink time.</p>
            <p>Xelos was in class, and his friend Maya was there too. They talked about their stubbornness and how they refused to visit their families, even though they lived in Omega city. As the class went on, Xelos recorded it with his LensTech contacts while he and Maya continued their conversation.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, they noticed storm clouds gathering above them, and with each step they took, the sky seemed to darken. There was another flash in the sky, and the northern lights appeared, something that had never happened before. Xelos saw figures in the sky, glowing knights with wings, but Maya didn't see anything.</p>
            <p>After class, Xelos and Maya went outside, still talking about what had happened. Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them. It was Chro, the mysterious old man from before.</p>
